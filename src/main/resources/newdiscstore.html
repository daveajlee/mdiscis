<h2 style="text-align:center;">New Disc Store</h2>

<p>A new disc store can be created at any time through the menu bar at the top of the screen by clicking "File" and then "New". You will be asked to confirm that you do not want to save changes to the previous disc store that you were working on. You must then add a disc to the disc store by clicking on "Add Another Disc" before the other functionality of the main window will be enabled.</p>
