<p>The main screen of MDISCIS provides easy access to most of the program's functionality.<br/><br/>

You can choose a disc from the drop-down arrow and the contents of that disc will appear in the main display area with the track number, date, subject, talk title and speaker. If the disc has more than 10 tracks, these can be viewed by clicking on the "Next Track(s)" button. The original 10 tracks can be viewed by clicking on the "Previous Track(s)" button. To edit a track, click on the edit button beside the track you wish to edit (see the "Edit Track" help topic for more information). To delete a track, click on the delete button beside the track you wish to delete (see the "Delete Track" help topic for more information). To add another track, click on the "Add Track(s)" at the bottom of the screen (see the "Add Track(s)" help topic for more information).   <br/><br/>

You can also clear a disc, by clicking on the "Clear Disc" button (see the "Clear Disc" help topic for more information). Deletion of a disc is possible through the "Delete Disc" button (see the "Delete Disc" help topic for more information). You can also add another disc at any time by clicking on the "Add Another Disc" button (see the "Add Another Disc" help topic for more information).<br/><br/>

Finally, a menu system provides access to create a new disc store, load a disc store and save a disc store. Please see the relevant help topic for more information.
